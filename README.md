# plover-default-symbols-punctuations
Plover has many symbols and punctuations defined by default in `main.json`. While they are defined at the Plover [non-letter page,](https://www.openstenoproject.org/learn-plover/lesson-7-non-letters.html) it is not organized well and is incomplete. This GitHub repo has files that communicate the various default Plover strokes for symbols and punctuations. Color vs non-color and pdf vs png are available.
